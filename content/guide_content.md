# STEP 1: Make an Appointment

It’s okay if you don’t know how to pay for an appointment, or how you will get to a clinic yet. Most people don’t. The first step is to make an appointment. 

## Finding a clinic

Two good sources for finding a clinic at any time in pregnancy are ineedana.com and abortionfinder.org. These sources will help you make sure that you don’t end up at a Crisis Pregnancy Clinic (more on that below\!).  
If you are looking specifically for care offered after 24wks, this list of providers from Ibis Reproductive Health might be a good place to start. 

## Scheduling an appointment

You might have to call a few places to ask about an appointment. Although it can be frustrating, know that each clinic you call is trying their best to help you.

When you call to schedule an appointment, the person you talk to will have a list of questions. This is sometimes called an “intake.” Some of the questions might feel weird and personal, or unrelated to abortion. They ask these questions so that they can help figure out the best place for you to get your abortion. The doctor also needs some information ahead of time.   
Because of the intake questions, you might want to make your calls when you have at least ten to fifteen minutes available. We recommend you make these phone calls from somewhere that you will feel comfortable talking about your medical history.  
If you can’t call from a private place, that’s okay too. Clinics understand that you are balancing a lot. Call when you can, even if it’s not the perfect time.   
**Also, we encourage you to ask about STI testing\!** Some clinics will offer testing, but if they don’t, ask them about it. There’s no reason to be ashamed of having an STI and some can increase the chances that you’ll get an infection during the procedure, so it’s better to know your test results before your procedure.

### Some questions to prepare for:

* Your height and weight  
* Your blood type  
* How many times you have been pregnant  
* If you have ever had a c-section  
* If you take any medications  
* If you have any allergies

We encourage you to ask about UTI testing. If you have an abortion when you have a UTI, it can increase the chances that you’ll get an infection, so it’s better to know your test results before your procedure.

## \[i\] What is a crisis pregnancy center?
Crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) are fake clinics that are run by people who are against abortion. In some places, CPCs outnumber abortion clinics 12 to 1\!   
CPCs look just like abortion clinics so that people who want abortions will go to them for help and information. They are designed to trick people into changing their mind about getting an abortion. This means that it can be really easy to go to a CPC when you want to go to an abortion clinic. It’s important to know that the people who work there often do not have any medical training.

## \[i\] How to spot crisis pregnancy centers
* They use words like “pregnancy options”, “pregnancy care center” or “pregnancy resource center”. 
* They tell you it’s too late in your pregnancy to get an abortion--even when that’s not true.   
* They might make you watch videos that describe fake consequences or risks to abortion, or make you listen to the electro-pulse or the ‘heartbeat’.   
* They will not refer you to an abortion clinic.  
* The “clinic” offers free pregnancy tests and then refuses to give you the results of your pregnancy test. 

# STEP 2: Paying For Your Appointment

There are places that exist to help folks like you get the money you need to pay for your appointment. Later abortion care is expensive. Almost nobody has the cash ready to pay for urgent medical care that can cost $2,000-$20,000 or more. Abortion clinics know this.   
Please note that paying for your abortion will be a bit different depending if your abortion is scheduled in a hospital setting. 

## Abortion funds — your first stop

Once you have your appointment scheduled, you will probably be asked to contact the National Abortion Federation (NAF) Hotline and/or your local abortion fund. These are the organizations that will help you pay for your abortion.

### The National Abortion Federation (NAF)

You can find the NAF hotline here: [https://prochoice.org/patients/naf-hotline/](https://prochoice.org/patients/naf-hotline/)  
NAF will ask for “qualifying information” to determine your level of need. They use this information to determine how much funding they can contribute to your care. They will ask questions like “how much you have in savings” or “whether you receive child support payments”. **They will not ask for any proof or backup for the answers you give them.** Our advice is to tell them that you have nothing. 

### The National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF)

This is a collection of independent groups in states all across the country who exist to help people get abortions. Visit their simple, step-by-step process for finding care here: [https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/](https://abortionfunds.org/need-abortion/)

### \[i\] Solidarity funding
If your pregnancy has advanced past 24wks, your funding may come from multiple different organizations. They will work on your behalf and therefore you will not need to coordinate this yourself\! This practice is referred to as “solidarity funding”.

## Checking your insurance coverage

Some states cover abortion care through Medicaid. You can check [the guide from the National Network of Abortion Funds](https://abortionfunds.org/need-an-abortion/abortion-and-medicaid/) on whether and how you can use Medicaid in your state. Note that if you need to travel outside your state for your abortion, you cannot use Medicaid.

California, Main, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, and New York *require* state-regulated private insurance to cover abortions.

If abortion is legal in your state, it is a good idea to contact your insurance and ask them if it is covered in your specific instance. Sometimes abortion is covered in cases of rape, incest, or fetal abnormalities, but not others.

## Paying for care in hospital settings

There are many reasons why people have abortions in hospital settings.  
Keep in mind that, although it may seem weird, people working in hospitals often do not know how much their appointments and procedures cost or the details of paying for care with or without insurance.  
If the person you are speaking to doesn’t have an answer for you about your insurance, the cost of your care, or any other questions you have, ask them to confirm with someone else in the hospital who will have an answer.

### Paying WITHOUT insurance

If you have been told by a clinic that you need to get your care in a hospital, and you don’t have insurance or the hospital does not take your insurance, **you still have options\!**  
**Abortion funds for complex care**  
The Chicago Abortion Fund, for example, is one of many organizations that connects people with complex needs to hospital care through their [CARLA support line](https://www.carlaprogram.org/).  
**‘Self-pay’ procedures**  
If the hospital does not take your insurance, or if you do not have insurance, you can ask if your procedure can be processed as a ‘self-pay’. ‘Self-pay’ prices are set beforehand, and are less expensive than the prices that the hospital charges to insurance companies.  
**Find out the price\!**  
If the hospital doesn’t take your insurance, or if they do not have self-pay prices set up, or even if it’s taking a long time to get answers, you may be tempted to say that you will just pay the bill later, whatever it is. This can be incredibly expensive and **we strongly encourage you to figure out what the price is ahead of time.**

### Paying WITH insurance

**Does the hospital take your insurance?**  
If you are scheduling your abortion in a hospital setting, and if you have insurance, ask if the hospital takes your insurance, and if any prior-authorization is necessary. Make sure to ask whether they accept your exact insurance plan.  
**Do you need prior-authorization for out-of-state care?**  
Most insurance plans are specific to the state you live in. Sometimes your insurance company will cover out-of-state care but they might require that you get prior-authorization to do this.  
Prior-authorization means that someone at the hospital places a formal request to insurance company before a procedure happens. If this is required by your insurance company, you must get prior-authorization before the procedure takes place, or your insurance will not cover the procedure.

# STEP 3: Preparing for your appointment

After you schedule an appointment, there are a lot of things that have to happen so that you can get there.

## What to bring to your appointment

If you are travelling for your appointment make sure to pack these items in an obvious and easy-to-access place, like a purse, backpack, or anything you

* A piece of government-issued photo ID. If you don’t have one, ask the clinic if they can accept something else before you leave for the appointment.  
* A copy of your insurance card, if you have one.  
* Comfortable clothes. Don't worry, there is no dress code for your appointment, but you will want to be comfortable both during your appointment and while you travel. You may want to have loose fitting or soft clothes. You may also want to have a sports bra for after the procedure.

### Other things to think about when packing:

When you have the procedure, you may be asked to take your jewelry off. Although your belongings will be stored for you, if there’s anything especially important to you, and if you have a safe place to keep it at home, you might want to leave it at home.

After the abortion, you will probably experience some bleeding that is like a period or spotting. The clinic will have pads to give you when you leave, you might want to bring your preferred pads with you.

Having light, plain snacks can help with potential feelings of nausea after the appointment.

Consider what other things might feel supportive for you to have after your appointment, such as a favorite pillow, book, journal, or game.

## Protestors

If you schedule an appointment with a freestanding abortion clinic, it’s possible that there will be anti-abortion protestors outside. We don’t want you to be scared, but we want to share some information to help prepare you beforehand.  
First, we want you to know that you will never have to go into a secondary location before you go into the clinic. Sometimes abortion protestors pretend to work for the clinic and tell you that you need to go with them into an ultrasound van parked outside before you go into the clinic. ***You do not need to go with them. You will never need to go to a second location before entering the clinic.***   
We recommend that you wear headphones and listen to loud music when you’re entering the clinic so that you don’t have to even hear what the protestors are saying.   
Many clinics that have protestors also have escorts there to walk with you into the clinic and physically block you from having to see the protestors. They might be wearing colorful vests or have rainbow umbrellas. When you make the appointment, ask the clinic if they are escorts outside so that you know who to look for when you arrive at the clinic. 

# 

# STEP 4: Travelling to your appointment

After you schedule an appointment, there are a lot of things that have to happen so that you can get there. 

## Flying

You need a government photo ID to fly. See the list of accepted government IDs here [https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification) 

Plane tickets will have two times on them: a boarding time and a time of departure. Get to the airport about two hours before the boarding time that is listed on your ticket.

When you get to the airport you have the option to check a bag and then you will go through a security line. This line can sometimes move very slowly, which is why you need to get there two hours early. 

Usually, your ticket will allow you to bring two bags with you: one smaller personal bag like a purse or back pack, and one medium sized suitcase that will fit in the overhead compartment on the plane. See our recommended packing list for ideas of what to bring (add link here)

When you get to the airport, you can check one of these bags or bring it with you on the plane as your “carry-on”. The maximum size of your carry-on varies by airline (usually around 22" x 14" x 9"). Checking a bag means giving it to the airline so that they can put it in a separate compartment on the plane. Although a lot of people check their bags, sometimes the bag is delayed, or can get lost. If there is anything especially important to you, we recommend that you bring it with you on the plane. You also cannot include some items like batteries, lighters, or aerosols in your checked baggage. Note that you cannot take any liquid that is in a container that is bigger than 3 fluid ounces onto the plane with you. Put all containers that have liquid in them together in one clear plastic bag in your carry-on. 

When you go through the security line, you will be asked to show your ticket and an official government ID to someone who works in the airport. Then you will go through the security line. You will probably be asked to take your shoes, jacket, belt and hoodie off. You will put your bags on a security belt and they will put your bags through a machine that scans them. You are not allowed to take with sharp items (knives, scissors, weapons) lighters, batteries, alcohol or drugs in your carry on. If you have any of these things, they will take them from you. Some airports have police dogs that are there to check for substances like marijuana and other illegal drugs. 

After going through security, look for the screen that shows the list of all the different destinations for the planes that are leaving the airport. This screen will show you what gate to go to for your plane. Follow signs in the airport for your gate. You can walk around the airport if you want, but make sure to return to your gate when your plane is boarding according to your ticket. Announcements will be made in the airport and the screens with gate numbers will be updated to tell you about any changes to your flight.

Once your plane is boarding, get in line with the other passengers, and be prepared to show your boarding pass and government photo ID. The flight attendants will then assist you to find your seat. The flight attendants will do a safety demonstration to show you how to stay safe on the flight. 

Once you have landed, if you have reached your final destination, you can gather your bags, make sure you have checked thoroughly that you have everything with you. If you had a checked back, follow the signs in the airport for baggage claim. You can then follow signs for the exit to leave the airport.

If you have a connecting flight, do not exit the airport. Instead, look at the information screens to see where the gate for your next flight is. If you are confused, a flight attendant from your first flight can help.

## Taking the train or bus 

Trains and buses start in one city or town and stop many times along the way to the ‘destination’ city or town. 

If you are getting on in the city or town where the train starts, you will be able to board ahead of the departure time on your ticket. If you are getting onto the train after the train has left its first city, you will wait on a track, and the train or bus will arrive at your station and be at the station for only one or two minutes, while people get off and then you can get on. If you are taking an Amtrak train, you probably don’t have an assigned seat unless you paid for business class. If there isn’t a seat number written on your ticket, then you don’t have an assigned seat, and can sit anywhere that is open when you board the train or bus. 

If you are getting off the train or bus in a city or town that is not the final destination, keep track of where it is along the route so that you don’t miss your stop. 

It can sometimes feel nerve-wracking to know if you are getting on the right train or bus, or whether you are waiting on the right track. Don’t be shy about asking the people around you if you are in the right place. 

There are bathrooms on the train. There will be a snack car or snack cart where you can buy food and drinks, but it is usually expensive.

There is usually a bathroom on the bus, but there will probably only be one and it is possible that it will be out of order.  

## Staying in a Hotel: 

When you first get to the hotel, go to the front desk to check-in. The front desk will ask you for a photo ID and a credit card to put on file. You usually have to have a credit card with you in-person to stay in a hotel. If you don’t, practical support organizations and abortion funds may be able to help with this\! 

If your travel has been organized with the help from a practical support organization or an abortion fund, they will help you with these logistics as well. 

People working at the hotel might ask you questions about why you’re visiting their city or town or what your plans are to make small talk. It’s none of their business, but you might want to think about what you will say to them ahead of time so you don’t feel panicked or anxious and accidentally feel pressured to tell them more than you want to about why you are there. 

Hotels have check-in and check-out times, which are when you can enter your hotel room on the first day and when you have to leave your hotel room on the last day. Usually, check-in times are around 3pm, and check-out times are around 11am. When you check out, make sure you visit the front desk again to give back your hotel room keys.

# STEP 5: The procedure  

## Dilation and Evacuation (D\&E) Procedure Overview

For some people, it’s helpful to know what will happen at every step of the process and to be able to picture each step. For other people, it's more stressful to anticipate what will happen. As you use this manual, please think about what sounds like it will be better/easier to you. There are more detailed technical descriptions of what happens in each appointment described below. But please skip it if you think it will not help you to know more. 

\[Add button to open rest of the content\]

The steps of the procedure and how many appointments you need are different based on how many weeks pregnant you are.

At around 14 weeks into pregnancy, the abortion procedure is called a dilation and evacuation or D\&E for short. It can also be referred to as “procedural abortion” or “surgical abortion”. You might hear some people say D\&C (Dilation and Curettage) and wonder what the difference is. There is no difference between a D\&C and a D\&E apart from the number of weeks pregnant you are at the time of the procedure. D\&E procedures are safe and one the most available kinds of abortion procedures. Before 16 or 17 weeks, a D\&E typically takes one day.

As you get farther into the pregnancy, and depending on where you are having your abortion, you might have a two-day D\&E procedure. This happens starting at 16 or 17 weeks into the pregnancy. When you have a two-day procedure, you do not stay overnight at the clinic or hospital. They call it a two-day procedure because the provider does a smaller in-office procedure during the first appointment where they insert dilators. This makes it even safer and faster for them to do the procedure during the next appointment. 

Starting at \~22 weeks into pregnancy, you will likely be scheduled for another appointment (total of three). During the first you will receive an IFD (induced fetal demise) injection. At the second appointment, the provider inserts dilators into your vagina. At your third appointment the provider will do the procedure. 

D\&E procedures can be done safely and effectively both in outpatient clinics and in hospitals’ operating rooms. Outpatient clinics may be preferable if you are paying for your abortion without insurance coverage, or if you are trying to schedule the procedure as quickly as possible. Folks with complex medical conditions, high BMI, or history of c-section might be referred to hospital settings for their abortion. Many hospital settings regularly provide abortion care. When you are scheduling a procedure in a hospital, there are a few more logistics to figure out, and you might have one or two more appointments for preparation before the procedure. A procedure in a hospital setting will be more expensive if you don’t have insurance, or if they do not accept the insurance that you have.  See our section 2\. Paying for your appointment for help.

\*If you would like a more technical description of the D\&E procedure, see our note labelled “How does a D\&E work?”\[link\]\*

### How long does it take? 

On the day that you have the procedure, you should plan to be there for ***at least 6 to 8 hours***. If you have any appointments before you have your procedure (such as to insert dilators or IFD), you should plan to be there for at least 3-4 hours. You are welcome to bring magazines or your phone charger. 

The D\&E itself is short. It usually takes about 30 minutes max. However, there are a lot of things that the doctors and nurses need to do behind the scenes, including blood work and other preparation. This means that there can be a lot waiting when you come for your appointments. 

As one doctor says “lots of things make a procedure longer but not more dangerous. If we're there for longer, there's probably just something we have to take our time with."

### How does a D\&E work?

D\&E procedures use suction and medical tools to empty your uterus. The procedure usually lasts about 30 minutes. You will be asked to arrive at least two hours before the procedure itself. When it’s time to have the procedure, you will go into a room that may look like an operating room or an exam room in a gynecologists’ office. You may have an IV inserted in your arm for sedation. You will lie down on the bed with your feet in the footrests or stirrups. 

### (click to expand for more) Technical description of a two-day procedure: 

If you have a two day-procedure, during your first appointment, the provider will insert dilators into your cervix before the procedure. Dilators can be described as being somewhat like tampons. They are inserted into your cervix and slowly expand to help open your cervix. You can then go home or back to the place that you are staying. The next day you will return to the office or clinic for the procedure. You may feel some discomfort and cramping after the dilators are inserted. Many providers will encourage you to take pain medication like Advil or Tylenol to manage this discomfort. 

### Will I feel the procedure?

When you have a D\&E, you will be under sedation for the procedure. There are different kinds of sedation, but whatever type of sedation you have, you will not feel the procedure happening. Moderate sedation (for example, with fentanyl/versed, propofol, or ketamine) is, in our experience, *plenty* for outpatient D\&Es. One of the doctors that we work with says: “most people either don’t remember their procedures, or are snoozing or chatting during their procedures and say ‘wait, that’s it?’ once I’m done”. 

Some people seek care in hospitals because they want to be under general anesthesia (i.e. completely asleep). When you have the procedure under general anesthesia, you will wake up from anesthesia in a recovery space and wait for the effects to wear off. Some people like the idea of being asleep, but people who get the procedure under moderate sedation confirm that they do not feel like they are “awake” during the procedure.

## Induced Fetal Demise (no preview, warning text)

Induced Fetal Demise, or IFD, refers to an injection that immediately stops the fetal heart before it is delivered or removed from your body.  It is sometimes called a “feticidal injection.” These injections are done to ensure your safety, and that’s the main priority during an abortion.  

There are three different injections used: digoxin, KCL, and lidocaine. All three are done either through the abdomen or through the vagina. Lidocaine and KCL typically work instantaneously.  Digoxin can take 2-5 hours to work and has a 2-5% failure rate, which may require a repeat injection.

Abdominal injections can feel uncomfortable. The pain has been compared to other injection pain. If you’ve ever experienced an amniocentesis, it can feel similar. One of the doctors that we work with says “In my experience, most people who feel anything at all call it a 2/10 for pain, and most people feel a sense of relief once it’s done.” 

## Induction Abortion  

An induction abortion involves ending the pregnancy and then going through labor and delivery to pass the pregnancy. There are different reasons why someone might have an induction abortion. You might be at a stage of pregnancy where the only abortion that can happen is an induction abortion. Or you might choose to have an induction because you want to be able to have an experience that is like labor and delivery, to be able to view the pregnancy, and to take your time saying goodbye after the pregnancy is over. 

While these procedures are usually only appropriate for people \>24 weeks, they are sometimes available as early as 22 weeks for people who really want to have a viewing and take their time.

Not every site can do an induction abortion, but there are providers who are regularly able to coordinate them.

For an induction abortion, you receive an injection to end the pregnancy. Once the doctor is sure there are no longer signs of cardiac activity, you will go through a process that is similar, although not exactly the same, as delivering a pregnancy. 

Induction and Evacuation procedures use osmotic dilators (laminaria and/or Dilapan) for dilation, then use labor induction techniques (with misoprostol and possibly pitocin) to get even more dilation, usually (but not always) resulting in an intact fetus.

Sometimes people have an induced fetal demise at the clinic, then go to a hospital to deliver.

This can happen for a few reasons.

* The induction & evacuation clinics usually don’t go past 32-34 weeks for their outpatient procedures.  Past that gestation, you may need an in-hospital induction.  
* Sometimes people prefer to have an in-hospital induction.  They may be close with their OB, or prefer to be closer to family.  
* A D\&E abortion might not be available in their area.  
* They might have a critical medical condition that requires them to be in a hospital to deliver for their safety.

## Cesarean Abortion Overview

Conditions requiring a cesarean abortion are very rare.  You might have a cesarean abortion if you have a placenta accreta or a placenta previa, both of which are medical circumstances that have to do with where your placenta is. Checking for placenta accreta and placenta previa is one of the major reasons that providers will do an ultrasound in office. If there is a need for you to consider or prepare for a cesarean abortion, your provider and/or your medical team will talk with you about it first. 

## Memory making and viewing (no preview)

It is often possible to get hand and footprints.  Your provider may bring it up, but if they don’t, you can always ask if it’s possible, or if they have other options for memory making.  

Viewing products of conception after a later D\&E can be challenging.  Not all clinics have experience helping people with these viewings, or have the culture of trusting you to decide if you want to do a viewing.  

If you have had an induction abortion, you have gone through an experience like labor, and what you would see is closer to what you might expect to see. 

A provider we work with says “Your body did something, and if you want to know about it, how could I keep that from you? You’re the best person to decide whether or not to view.  If you feel you want to see, see – don’t let fear stop you.  If you feel you’ve found a way to say goodbye to the pregnancy in your heart, then let that be your comfort”.

You may also be able to coordinate private burial or cremation if you want to. If you are interested in this, ask the clinic if that is something they are able to do. If they are, you would need to pay for burial or cremation yourself, but the clinic would help coordinate with the funeral home of your choice.  

## Questions about fetal pain (as a call-out/faq)

A lot of people ask about fetal pain. Our best science right now is consistent with there being no fetal pain.  No pain.  No suffering.  The oxygen level that a fetal brain lives at is about the same that you or I would be at on the top of Mt. Everest.  It’s not enough to maintain consciousness.

For comparison, consider being born: it’s a process that involves a fetus/baby getting its head squeezed until it fits through a pelvis and vaginal canal.  It’s something nobody would ever consider doing to a newborn.  And yet, nobody is out there suggesting we anesthetize fetuses before vaginal delivery, and nobody remembers being in pain while being born.  We’re simply not set up to consciously perceive pain at any stage in utero.


# STEP 6: Aftercare & follow-ups

## Follow-up appointments

If you have travelled out of state for your procedure, you may want to schedule a follow-up appointment several weeks after your procedure. When you make this appointment, you want to make sure that this follow-up appointment is safe for you, and will allow you to get the care you need without putting you in danger of disclosing that you got an abortion. This is especially true if you are living in a state where abortion has been banned. 

One option is to go to a Planned Parenthood for follow-up care. You can find the Planned Parenthood that is closest to you on [their website](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-center).

Please note that if you go to the ER with concerns after your abortion, or to see your regular OBGYN, and you live in a total ban state, **you should probably not disclose your abortion.  It may be illegal for you, depending on the state that you live in.** There is no way to tell if someone has had an abortion or a miscarraige, so you can tell medical providers that you had a miscarriage if you have to.  [This map](https://states.guttmacher.org/policies/tennessee/abortion-policies) has information about state level abortion restrictions.

If you have any questions about what is or is not legal, you can call If/When/How’s free Repro Legal Helpline at 844-868-2812 or visit their website [here](https://ifwhenhow.org/). 

## Milk Drying

If you are 16 weeks or more pregnant at the time of your abortion, your chest will likely start to make milk. This happens when the body reacts to the shift in hormone balance that takes place when a pregnancy ends. Unrelieved milk production makes your chest engorged. As the milk comes in, your chest may feel larger, heavier, very firm and quite tender to the touch. If you do nothing about engorgement, your milk should start drying up on its own within a few days and associated tenderness should be gone in a week. But that can feel like a long time when you’re experiencing physical discomfort.

**For some people it feels like their body is betraying them when this happens.** For folks who are trans or non-binary, it might trigger feelings of gender dysphoria. For people who are ending a wanted pregnancy, it can be an emotionally painful reminder of a baby you were very much looking forward (if this is you, Grace O’s guide [**“Help\! My Milk Came In\!”**](https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/help-my-milk-came-in/) was written especially for you).

There are several ways you can quicken the milk drying process and help feel comfortable during it.

To quicken the drying process:

**Sudafed** is a common over-the-counter decongestant. It is available in brand or generic form behind the counter of most drug stores. Research shows the Sudafed causes a noticeable decrease in milk production.

**Cabbage leaves** is not an old wives’ tale. Cabbage leaves really do help. Regular green cabbage contains sinigrin, magnesium, oxylate, mustard oil, rapine and sulphur heterosides. This natural mixture of compounds reduces tissue congestion by dilating the small blood vessels to improve blood flow to the area.

To use, crush the green cabbage leaves with a rolling pin to break the veins and to better accommodate the shape of your chest. You can snip out a hole for your nipple if that is more comfortable for you.

Place the cabbage leaves over your chest, inside of your bra or binder. Leave it in place until they wilt, usually 2-4 hours. Some people report relief about 8 hours after treating with cabbage leaves. You can stop using the cabbage as soon as the engorgement goes down.

Note:  Cabbage leaves are not recommended if you are allergic to cabbage or sulfa.

To stay comfortable during the drying process:

* Binding/Tight bra(s)

**Binding or tighter bras** might help you feel more comfortable. Improperly fitted bras, and particularly underwire bras, may further constrict milk flow causing mastitis (an inflammation of chest tissue that sometimes involves an infection). Our recommendation is to wear one or even two tight sports bras or binders at the same time. Wear them as much as you possibly can, even to bed. The tightness will relieve pain and prevent stimulation.

**Over the counter pain relievers** such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Motrin), or whatever prescription pain reliever your doctor may have prescribed following your procedure can help.  In addition to reducing pain, they will minimize swelling.

**Ice packs and cold compresses** help with the swelling and the pain. Crushed ice or ice cubes in a Ziplock bag, or even a bag of frozen peas or corn from your freezer can relieve your discomfort and diminish swelling. Wrap them in a thin towel and apply for about 20 minutes at a time.

Do not use warm compresses in order to relieve engorgement. Overuse of warm compresses may actually increase milk production.

**Drink as much as you want during this time. Restricting fluids will not relieve your engorgement.** 

Most importantly, hang in there. The first several days following your abortion can be really overwhelming and intense. It is our hope that these strategies will provide you with some small measures of control.

## Emotional Aftercare

Connecting to communities of people who have had abortions can be a really helpful for folks. Some of these include people telling stories about their own experiences, and groups that are specifically to support people’s emotions after they have had an abortion. These include counselling textlines, and peer support groups. A selection of these are posted on our resources page (link). One that may be of particular interest is the Postpartum Support International’s support group for people who have terminated for medical reasons (link to specific part of resources page)

You might also want to talk to someone about your experience. There are helplines which you can text for support, as well as lists of pro-abortion mental health providers. These can also be found on our resources page.
