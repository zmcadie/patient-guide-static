          <h1>About this site</h1>
          <p>
            This guide has been made by small group of people who have experience with abortion care, particularly for people getting abortions later in pregnancy. Our group includes a physician who performs later abortions, practical support folks who help people travel to clinics and pay for their care, and patients who have had later abortions.
          </p>
          <h1>What do we mean when we say “later abortion”</h1>
          <p>
            Hundreds of thousands of people get abortions every year. This means that every year a LOT of people of people get abortions that can be called “later abortions”. If you are getting an abortion at this stage in pregnancy, know that you’re not alone. A “later abortion” is any abortion happening at 15 weeks into a pregnancy or later. It’s called a later abortion because statistically, the majority of abortions happen in the first few months of pregnancy. Therefore, any procedure after 15 weeks is considered “later” abortion.
            <br>
            There are so many reasons why people seek later abortion. One of the big reasons is that as more and more abortion bans are being passed all over the country, it is taking longer for people to get to their appointments because they can’t find an appointment close to home.
          </p>
          <h1>Finding Your 15wk+ Abortion i.e. “The Bop Around”</h1>
          <p>
            Finding and getting to a later abortion appointment can take a lot of phone calls, messages, and waiting for people to call you back. There’s a term for this within the abortion help network. It’s called “the bop around.” You might call two or three clinics before you are able to make an appointment. We know that this can feel really frustrating.
            <br>
            If you have any reason to think that your pregnancy has progressed past the first trimester, we highly recommend that you find your way to an abortion clinic. We know that can feel daunting but we encourage you to stick with it.
            <br>
            While you may find stories online of people who manage their 2nd trimester abortions themselves at home using pills: your risk of being criminalized, or punished by your state, grows exponentially as your pregnancy progresses. This is especially true for folks who are already at higher risks of being criminalized, particularly people of color. If you have specific questions about the legality of ending your pregnancy, please reach out to the folks at the Repro Legal Helpline: https://www.reprolegalhelpline.org/
